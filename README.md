# What's this?

A Minecraft plugin for Bukkit/Spigot/PaperMC that listens for a right click with a lodestone compass

When you right click with a lodestone compass:
- You are teleported **on top** of the lodestone it points to
- It says "Whoosh!" in the chat
- The compass is consumed

You must
- Right click into air, not on a block
- Have a valid lodestone compass, pointing to an existing lodestone (in **any dimension**)
- Ensure that there is nothing directly above the lodestone yourself, **the plugin will not check**

That is all. I wrote this with almost zero experience with Spigot plugins. Used for a private server.

SEE ALSO: A [Data Pack](https://github.com/NicolasBissig/Lodeport) that does something very similar. 

I hope this repository is useful to someone who is looking for a plugin like this - When I googled around (at time of creation) I couldn't find anything.

You can get the .jar file [here](https://github.com/percyqaz/LodestoneTeleport/releases/) - Versions available for 1.16.2 - 1.18.1
